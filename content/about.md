Let's Improvise is a blog where I publish my collection of knowledge, works and whatever interesting notes I can gather around the week. I will be writing here on a range of topics they include:
- **Technology**: I am really into web development, GNU/Linux system administration, hardware and free(libre) software.
- **Politics and "the system"**: My opinions on politics and the system we live in. I highly defy it.
- **Philosophy**: I do have some deep thoughts and analysis about the world around us I will be discussing it here.
- **Religion**: The perfect nature always inspires you to learn about the creator that is where religion comes in.
- **Digital Privacy**: I am a privacy and secuirity advocate and believe that our data should never be sold to the highest bidder and big brother. I also will talk about practices to improve our online privacy. 

    And basically whatever else I feel like to talk about and give my opinions on.
I am a really open-minded person so expect some of my opinions to change and I am a perpetual student learning mostly through my personal experiences, my travels and books. So, Let's Improvise.
